      <h2 class=""section__title"">Experience in development</h2>
      <p class=""section__paragraph"">
        In September 2019 with two teammates began development the Flask web application for automating routine work processes.
      </p>
      <p class=""section__paragraph"">
        After three months we released a minimum viable program, that was a great expansion of horizons and a breakthrough in efficiency - until recently, we did something in 20 clicks,
        then just 1-2 clicks or completely without man participation. That time we felt like we were doing some kind of magic :)
      </p>
      <p class=""section__paragraph"">
        For the project I attracted an experienced developer as a mentor, thanks to him we got acquainted with
         Python, Flask, Redis Queue, PostgreSQL, Git and APIs of third-party services.
      </p>
      <p class=""section__paragraph section__paragraph_layout_above-list"">
        Until spring 2021, we continued to develop the web application, as a result, business processes were digitized:
      </p>
      <ul class=""list"">
        <li class=""list__item"">customer order processing, address processing, tagging, product availability check,</li>
        <li class=""list__item"">creating a requirement for a supplier based on the balance, expectations, reserve at the supplier,</li>
        <li class=""list__item"">receiving information about payments through the banking service via API,</li>
        <li class=""list__item"">automatic notifications to customers via SMS and email services,</li>
        <li class=""list__item"">notifications in Slack, then in Discord.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class=""section__paragraph"">
        Now we support the application and fix bugs.
         Since September 2021 I have been devoting more time to training in specialized  programming courses.

      <h2 class=""section__title"">Universal skills</h2>
      <p class=""section__paragraph"">
        I combine development with a management position where I am responsible for
        promotion, sales, an online store, motivation and organization of work processes for employees.
      </p>
      <p class=""section__paragraph section__paragraph_layout_above-list"">
        This wide area of responsibility
         and education with strict deadlines taught me universal skills:
      </p>
      <ul class=""list"">
